# OTEL: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love My Microservices

Microservices often get a bad rap for being complex, brittle, and hard to 
debug. What if the real problem isn’t the architecture, but the lack of 
visibility?
With proper observability, even the most labyrinthine microservice can be 
tamed.

That’s where OpenTelemetry (OTEL) comes in. By instrumenting tracing, metrics, 
and logs, it can shed light on the dark corners of your system,
turning confusion into clarity. In this talk, we’ll explore how OTEL helps 
teams regain control, share lessons from real-world deployments, and show how 
proper observability alleviate the headaches of using microservices.

If you’ve ever questioned your life choices while debugging a distributed 
system, this talk is for you. With the right observability strategy, you might 
just learn to love your microservices!
